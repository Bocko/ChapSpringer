\section{Introduction}

In order to continuously improve the performance of integrated circuits (IC), technologists have compelled themselves to follow the well-known Moore's Law (see Figure \ref{fig:mooreslaw}). This empirical law predicts a doubling of the transistors' density each 18 months and therefore increasing logic capacity of the circuit per unit area.

The improvements of 2D architectures are primarily driven by the reduction of the transistor size. However, with the miniaturization, quantum effects such as quantum tunnelling will significantly affect how a transistor behave. Indeed, even if a transistor is blocking, current can flow through due to quantum tunnelling such that it will be difficult to control its state and thus the basic working principle of a transistor \cite{1240081}. In addition to these physical aspects, economical considerations that will hinder the IC evolution beyond 20nm have to be taken into account \cite{5227192,PFF10}.

In order to overcome these limitations, new technologies have been proposed such as the carbon nanotubes \cite{tans1998room}, the nanowire transistors \cite{doi:10.1021/nl025875l}, the single-electron transistors \cite{citeulike:4194929}, and also the 3D-Stacked Integrated Circuits (3D-SIC) proposed by the academic and industrial communities. The latter has been often cited as the most prominent one as it is based on the current technologies and still uses silicon as basis material; 3D-SICs can also allow shorter interconnection lengths, smaller footprint, larger bandwidth, heterogeneous circuits among their main advantages \cite{659500,1652906,981091,4299568}.

Fast evolution of IC manufacturing technologies makes even the design of 2D-ICs a complex and tedious task with the growing number of design choices at the system level (e.g. number and type of functional units and memories, type and topology of the interconnection system, etc.) and physical level (respecting area/timing/power constraints). Using 3D-SICs introduces even more degrees of freedom: number of tiers, choices for manufacturing technology (e.g. full 3D integration, silicon interposer, face-to-face, back-to-face, etc.), 3D partitioning and placement strategies etc. These new degrees of freedom will contribute to the combinatorial explosion of already huge design spaces. Moreover, practice and 2D design experience cannot be fully exploited with 3D technology, since 3D-SICs change considerably the way ICs are implemented. Indeed, physical implementation of ICs involves solving several complex problems and hence work only with approximated solutions.

Current design flows can produce workable solutions after manual definition of the physical constraints as there are no preconceived method that can provide good solutions. Also, they are sequential in nature as certain parameters are fixed at certain stages in the flow, which can lead to locally optimal solutions that are far from global optimums so this requires time consuming (hence, costly) iterative processes to adjust these parameters. Since the 3D technology is even more complex than the 2D, it is necessary to improve the current design flows by developing design exploration \cite{PFF10}.

One of the solutions to face this problem is to develop high-level tools which can quickly explore design spaces and give early and reasonably accurate performance estimations based on physical prototyping of the 3D circuits~\cite{PFF10}. In addition, performance estimation/optimization and the selection of the most-suitable solutions usually implies to take several objectives into account (e.g. maximization of the performance, minimization of the cost, minimization of the package size, etc.).

Currently, these high-level design tools can be considered to follow a uni-criterion paradigm. Indeed, they have sequential development steps and each criterion is optimized without considering the impact on other criteria. This can lead to several rollbacks in the design flow since the achievement of the requirements can be time consuming (typical design iterations are measured in weeks). For instance, current tools will only minimize the area of a circuit to reach the timing constraints by solving a 2D place-and-route problem and this will be more complex with 3D-SICs because the system has also to be partitioned.

On the other hand, multi-criteria approaches have been developed to consider all the criteria simultaneously. Designing 3D-SICs inherently implies a huge design space and numerous degrees of freedom and criteria, hence many possible choices when it comes to decide upon the IC to produce. With these reasons, we propose in this work to apply a multi-criteria paradigm with the PROMETHEE methods for the design of 3D-SICs.

\subsection{Multi-criteria decision making tools: using the PROMETHEE methods}

In this subsection we recall the basics of the PROMETHEE and GAIA methods. Of course, a detailed description of these approaches goes beyond the scope of this contribution. Therefore we refer the interested reader to \cite{BraMar2005} for a detailed analysis.

Let $\mathcal{A}=\{a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n\}$ be a set of $n$ alternatives and $\mathcal{F}=\{f_1,f_2,\ldots,f_m\}$ be a set of $m$ criteria. Without loss of generality, we assume that all criteria have to be maximized. The PROMETHEE methods are based on pairwize comparisons. At first, each pair of alternatives $a_i,a_j \in \mathcal{A}$ is compared on every criterion $f_k$:

$$
d_k(a_i,a_j) = f_k(a_i) - f_k(a_j)
$$

The quantity $d_k(a_i,a_j)$ represents the \textit{advantage} of $a_i$ over $a_j$ for criterion $f_k$. On the one hand, when $d_k(a_i,a_j)$ is small enough, there is no good reason to say that $a_i$ is better than $a_j$ regarding criterion $f_k$. On the other hand, when $d_k(a_i,a_j)$ exceeds a certain limit, the decision maker may express that $a_i$ is strictly preferred to $a_j$ for $f_k$. In order to model these statements, the difference $d_k(a_i,a_j)$ is transformed into a unicriterion preference degree, denoted $ P_k(a_i,a_j)$, by using a non-decreasing function $H_k$;

$$
P_k(a_i,a_j) = H_k(d_k(a_i,a_j)), \; \; \forall \; a_i, a_j \; \in \; \mathcal{A}
$$

The quantity $P_k(a_i,a_j) \in [0, 1]$ and $P_k(a_i,a_j)=0$ when $d_k(a_i,a_j) <0$. There are plenty of functions that can be considered to compute the unicriterion preference degrees. In most software implementing the PROMETHEE method, $6$ main functions are considered \cite{Hayez}. Figure \ref{fig:criterion5} represents the so-called linear preference function. Two thresholds characterize it:
\begin{itemize}
\item $q_k$ plays the role of an \textit{indifference} threshold. When the difference $d_k(a_i,a_j) \leq q_k$, it is considered to be so small that the unicriterion preference is equal to zero;
\item $p_k$ plays the role of a \textit{preference} threshold, When the difference $d_k(a_i,a_j) \geq p_k$, it is considered to be important enough to state that $a_i$ is strongly preferred to $a_j$ for this criterion.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{criterion5.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Generalized criterion of type 5}
\label{fig:criterion5}
\end{figure}

Once the unicriterion preference degrees between two actions $a_i$ and $a_j$ have been computed for every criterion, one has to aggregate these marginal contributions to obtain $P(a_i,a_j)$  i.e. a global measure of the preference of $a_i$ over $a_j$:

$$
P(a_i,a_j)= \sum_{k=1}^{m} \omega_k \cdot P_k(a_i,a_j)
$$

where $\omega_k$ represents the relative importance of criterion $f_k$. These weights are assumed to be positive and normalized. Obviously, we have $P(a_i,a_j) \geq 0$ and $P(a_i,a_j) + P(a_j,a_i) \leq 1$.\

The PROMETHEE I and II rankings are based on the exploitation of the matrix $P$. Therefore, three flows are built.; the positive flow $\phi^+$, the negative flow $\phi^-$ and the net flow $\phi$:

$$
\phi^+(a_i)= \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{a_j \in \mathcal{A}, i \ne j}
P(a_i,a_j)
$$

$$
\phi^-(a_i)= \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{a_j \in \mathcal{A}, i \ne j}
P(a_j,a_i)
$$

$$
\phi(a_i)=\phi^+(a_i)-\phi^-(a_j)
$$

The PROMETHEE I ranking is obtained as the intersection of the rankings induced by $\phi^+$ and $\phi^-$. The PROMETHEE II ranking is given by the ranking given by $\phi$.

Finally, it is worth noting that:

$$
\phi(a_i) = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{k=1}^{m} \sum_{a_j \in \mathcal{A}} {[P_k(a_i,a_j)-P_k(a_j,a_i)]} \cdot \omega_k = \sum_{k=1}^{m} \phi_k(a_i) \cdot \omega_k
$$

where $\phi_k(a_i)$ is called the $k^{th}$ unicriterion net flow assigned to action $a_i$.

The PROMETHEE I and II ranking provide prescriptive tools for decision making. The GAIA \cite{MarBra1988} tool complements them with a descriptive approach. The idea is to represent each alternative by its evaluations in the unicriterion net flow space:

$$
\Phi(a_i)=[\phi_1(a_i),\phi_2(a_i),\ldots,\phi_m(a_i)]
$$

GAIA is the result of a principal component analysis applied on this dataset. Therefore, the decision maker is able to visualize the decision problem on a plane and compare:
\begin{itemize}
\item the relative positions of alternatives (in order to identify groups of similar or distinct alternatives profiles);
\item the relative positions of criteria (in order to identify conflicts or redundancies);
\item the relative positions of alternatives with respect to a given criterion (in order to identify the best and worst alternatives for the different points of views);
\item the relative positions of alternatives with respect to the so-called \textit{decision stick} (in order the identify the best compromise solutions).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Multi-criteria analysis}
With the simulations for the OpenSPARC-T2 SoC, we have obtained 70 designs evaluated on three criteria: the number of 3D nets (to be maximized), the total wire length (to be minimized) and the maximum wire length (to be minimized). The number of 3D nets represents a measure of the performance of a circuit, the total wire length its economical aspects while the maximum wire length will reflect both performance and cost. The alternatives are divided in 7 categories, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:alternatives}.

\subsubsection{Preliminary analysis}
As a preliminary analysis, we will first consider the three best unicriterion alternatives as the designers can be interested to know how the circuits are performing on each parameter: RandomL3~5 (for the number of 3D nets), Hier~L3~4 (for the total wire length) and RandomL3 8 (for the maximum wire length), as shown in Table~\ref{tab:bestunicritalt}. These would represent the choice of designers who would have their preferences only on performance or on low cost.

\begin{table}[h!]
    \begin{center}
        \caption{Best unicriterion alternatives}
        \label{tab:bestunicritalt}
        \begin{tabular}{p{2.3cm}p{1.5cm}p{2cm}p{1.3cm}}
            \hline
            Design name & 3D nets & Total WL & Max L\\
            \hline
            RandomL3 5 & 3421 & 784257.1375 & 355.1875 \\
            Hier L3 4 & 45 & 769255.55 & 599.8 \\
            RandomL3 8 & 2991 & 836486.01 & 324.92 \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

By analyzing the evaluations, we can observe that the Hier~L3~4 alternative, while being the best on the total wire length criterion (by a difference of 1.9\%), is really bad on the two other criteria: only 45 compared to 3421 (1.3\%) for the number of 3D nets, and 599.8 compared to 324.92 (54.2\%) for the maximum wire length. Given these poor evaluations this alternative may not represent a good compromise solutions and it would be necessary to make concession in order to achieve a better overall circuits.

With these preliminary analyses, we can already provide valuable multi-criteria information to a designer so that trade-off decisions would be eased. However, until now we only have considered alternatives that are optimal on one of the criteria. These are therefore not necessarily suitable as compromise solutions as we have observed previously. In the following we will use and analyze the PROMETHEE methods, with the D-Sight Web platform~\cite{dsightweb,Hayez}, that will allow us to rank all the alternatives and ease a decision process. We will consider two production scenarios given by an expert in the IC design field. The first one will consider a case where economical aspects are more important than the performances while the second one will put more emphasis on the performances, allowing concession on the economical aspects.

\subsubsection{PROMETHEE modeling: low cost production scenario}
The first step in the PROMETHEE methods is to model the decision maker's preferences. In our study, we will make the assumption that the preference functions are based on the usual criterion to simplify the questions asked to a designer who is not familiar with preference modeling. We will also elicit the weight of the criteria following a procedure similar to what is used in AHP.

The weights elicitation for this case is represented in Figure~\ref{fig:elicitcost}. The designer expresses the preference for a low cost circuit by putting more importance to the maximum wire length and total wire length criterion than on the number of 3D nets criterion. The resulting weights are given as follows: 9.53\% for the number of 3D nets, 24.99\% for the total wire length, and 65.48\% for the maximum wire length.

\begin{figure}[h!]

    \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{elicitcost.png}
    \caption{Low cost production scenario: weigths elicitation}
    \label{fig:elicitcost}
\end{figure}

The PROMETHEE II ranking with this preference model is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rankingcost}. We remark that the three first-ranked alternatives are Auto1000~3, RandomL3~5 and RandomL3~8. Without great surprise, the best unicriterion alternatives on the total wire length and the maximum wire length criteria are well-ranked due to their higher weights while the Hier~L3~4 (best on the number of 3D nets) is only ranked 43rd out of 70.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{rankingcost}
    \caption{Low cost production scenario: PROMETHEE II ranking}
    \label{fig:rankingcost}
\end{figure}

Let us now analyze the Auto1000~3 alternative compared to the second and third ones with their evaluations, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:top3cost}.

\begin{table}[h!]
    \begin{center}
        \caption{Low cost production scenario: top 3}

            \hline
            Rank & Design name & 3D nets & Total WL & Max L\\
            \hline
            1 & Auto1000 3 & 3301 & 800223.427 & 353.625 \\
            2 & RandomL3 5 & 3421 & 784257.1375 & 355.1875 \\
            3 & RandomL3 8 & 2991 & 836486.01 & 324.92 \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

\subsubsection*{Stability analysis}
Since the weigths have been elicited through a procedure similar to what is used in AHP, it is necessary to analyze whether a slight change in their value will affect the ranking. The stability intervals for each criterion is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:stabilitycost}. As we can observe, the possibilities of weight modification are rather large, which means that the Auto1000~3 is a stable compromise solution for this low cost production scenario.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{stabilitycost}
    \caption{Low cost production scenario: weigths stability intervals}
    \label{fig:stabilitycost}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{PROMETHEE modeling: high performance production scenario}
The weights elicitation for this case is represented in Figure~\ref{fig:elicitperf}. The designer expresses the preference for a high performance circuit by putting more importance to the number of 3D nets criterion and maximum wire length criterion than on the total wire length criterion. The resulting weights are given as follows: 59.36\% for the number of 3D nets, 15.71\% for the total wire length, and 24.93\% for the maximum wire length.

\begin{figure}[h!]

    \includegraphics[width=0.62\linewidth]{elicitperf.png}
    \caption{High performance production scenario: weigths elicitation}
    \label{fig:elicitperf}
\end{figure}

The PROMETHEE II ranking with this preference model is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rankingperf}. We remark that the three first-ranked alternatives are RandomL3~5, Auto1000~3 and RandomL2~7. Without great surprise, the best unicriterion alternative on the number of 3D nets criterion is ranked first.
